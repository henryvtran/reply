# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned most of the library by reading the included README.md file by the author while looking at the source and inspecting the /examples folder that was included in the reply module. Because the module had example codes already included, it was much easy to understand and write my own examples. A change that would have made it easier could have been the author giving better comments, unlike "just in case", which tells the reader nothing about the code (it's just there "just in case").


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Considering the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction", it means to simply tell what it generally does, not the specifics. The comment should still make sense even if the code is replaced with another which does the same thing but in a different way.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 5 hrs


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The main problem I encountered with this assignment was jsdoc, "ERROR: Unable to parse \reply\index.js: Line 100: Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode" taking most of my time. The assignment was pretty simple and helpful learning. 

##### NOTE: Octal literals removed therefore questions output are messed up in examples however it still works fine.
